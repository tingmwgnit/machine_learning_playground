# machine_learning_playground
This repository is where I practice machine learning methods on interesting datasets to draw meaningful insights and communicate them with visualizations. 
 
    
# Supervised Learning 
1. 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (binary classification, using random forest algorithm to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on their demographic information, coded in R): https://github.com/tingmwgnit/machine_learning_playground/blob/main/titanic/titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb
2. 🏠 House Price Prediction (regression, random forest, Python, Kaggle competition): https://github.com/tingmwgnit/machine_learning_playground/blob/main/house_price/House%20Prices.ipynb

# Unsupervised Learning 
1. 💻💰 Online Shopper Intention (customer segmentation based on their page visiting history using the K-means algorithm, some business insights and visualizations are also included in this project, coded in Python):  https://github.com/tingmwgnit/machine_learning_playground/blob/main/online_shoppers_intention.ipynb


# Self-Supervised Learning
use unlabled data to complete tasks that are usually done with labled data
# Semi-supervised learning 
This is a branch of machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training, it's useful when labeld data is expensive to obtain.
