# machine_learning_playground
This repository is where I practice machine learning methods (using Python and R) on interesting datasets to draw meaningful insights. 
 
    
# Supervised Learning (labled data)
+

# Semi-supervised learning (partially labled data)
+

# Unsupervised Learning (unlabeld data)
+ Clustering
    + Centroid based methods:
        + K-means algorithm
            1. ðŸ’»ðŸ’° Online Shopper Intention (customer segmentation using their page visiting history, some business insights and visualizations are also included in this project):  https://github.com/tingmwgnit/machine_learning_playground/blob/main/online_shoppers_intention.ipynb
    + Distribution based methods:

# Self-Supervised Learning (use unlabled data to complete tasks that are usually done with labled data)
+
