# machine_learning_playground
This repository is where I practice machine learning methods on interesting datasets to draw meaningful insights. Both Python and R were used.
 
    
# Supervised Learning (labled data)

# Semi-supervised learning (partially labled data)
+

# Unsupervised Learning (unlabeld data)
Customer Segmentation:
1. ðŸ’»ðŸ’° Online Shopper Intention (customer segmentation based on their page visiting history using the K-means algorithm, some business insights and visualizations are also included in this project, coded in Python):  https://github.com/tingmwgnit/machine_learning_playground/blob/main/online_shoppers_intention.ipynb


# Self-Supervised Learning (use unlabled data to complete tasks that are usually done with labled data)
